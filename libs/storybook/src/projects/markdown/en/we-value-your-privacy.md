My facial recognition skills are not great, but AI has the power to adapt CNN
into the surveillance system to target which people to send to the prison
unlawfully.

While General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has measurably improved the
privacy rights in Europe, it has stamped into the worst problems with the laws
that suffer from an enforcement gap- a wide disparity between the stated
protections in theory and the reality of how companies respond to it. It led
companies and European countries to invest significant resources in designing
regulatory compliance programs, but it didn’t make them really care about
customer’s privacy.

In 2023, five years after GDPR enforcement, the Irish Data Protection Commission
(DPC) pressed charges of €1.2 billion on Meta. This record-breaking fine was
issued for transferring personal data of European users to the United States
without adequate data protection mechanisms and serves as a significant
milestone in data protection regulation.

In 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (CNDP) issued a
fine of  €746 million ($888 million) to [Amazon.com](//Amazon.com) Inc. The CNPD
opened an investigation into how Amazon processes personal data of its customers
and found infringements regarding Amazon’s advertising targeting system that was
carried out without proper consent.

In 2018 the data breach arose from a bug in Twitter's design, due to which, if a
user on an Android device changed the email address associated with their
Twitter account, the protected tweets became unprotected and therefore
accessible to anyone (including authorities) without the user's knowledge.

In 2022 Saudi student at Leeds University after returning home for a holiday was
sentenced to 34 years in prison for having a Twitter account and for following
and retweeting dissidents and activists.

VisionLabs, owned by MTS and headquartered in the Netherlands, has created a
world-leading facial recognition technology. In 2022 at least 141 people were
detained preventively via facial recognition, according to data from OVD-Info.
Facial recognition technology uses artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze
and identify people.

In Moscow more than 160,000 cameras have been installed across the city - more
than 3,000 of them connected to the facial recognition system - have helped law
enforcement. Now more than 2,000 court cases show these cameras have played an
important role in the arrests of hundreds of protesters. Most of these people
were detained in 2021 after they joined anti-government demonstrations.

### How to implement tracking respecting the customers privacy?

Even though the purpose of tracking is to monitor the usage of a website, this
can still be done without collecting any personal data or personally
identifiable information (PII), without using cookies and while respecting the
privacy of the website visitors.

Tracking solutions are often overrated in terms of its usability. Finding the
right tools for your business product analysis can help you establish a better
control over what data is necessary for the analysis and reporting to make
business decisions, and which tools are supporting it while staying respectful
to visitor’s privacy.

- A/B testing

- Product level recording for funnel and retention analysis, user paths,
  behavioral cohorts and other UX metrics 

- software monitoring and observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana)

Most of the A/B testing providers use local storage to store IDs at user-level
cookies to track user journeys and understand their behavior across the website.
Marketers primarily deal with 

- First-party cookies that are sent to an internal server

- Third-party cookies created by external domains that send them to third-party
  servers such as LinkedIn, Google or Meta.

Cookies from third-parties allow any information from your visitors to be shared
with, sent to or sold to anyone, including advertisers’, so they’re seen as
intrusive and highly invasive of user privacy.

Anonymizing the data to avoid tracing across platforms based on information that
relates to an identified or identifiable living individual

- anonymizing the IP addresses

- aggregate data to prevent identification of individual users

- use pseudonymization techniques to protect any personally identifiable
  information (PII)

- disable User-ID tracking that makes it substantially harder for most
  advertisers and data brokers to track you

- disable data sharing settings that sends the data to third party services

#### Limited data sharing

- configure data retention settings to automatically delete user and event data
  after a certain period

- allow users to manage their preferences (when they need it)

- collect the data that is crucial only for business decisions and analysis

- use cookie-less tracking providers- Plausible, PostHog, matomo, umami

Find the privacy-first tracking tools- transparency about their data policy that
describes not only how the companies are handling their customer’s data but also
full disclosure from their clients.

If you can’t find the answers about the data policy from the document, AI might
do it for you. Jason Mayes showed an example to upload PDFs and chat about data
privacy via platform  AskYourPDF.

#### Personal data 

Personal data to be removed/pseudonymized from data collections and recordings

- a name and surname;

- a home address;

- an email address such as
  [name.surname@company.com](mailto:name.surname@company.com);

- an identification card number;

- location data (for example the location data function on a mobile phone)\*;

- an Internet Protocol (IP) address;

- a cookie ID\*;

- the advertising identifier of your phone;

- data held by a hospital or doctor, which could be a symbol that uniquely
  identifies a person.
