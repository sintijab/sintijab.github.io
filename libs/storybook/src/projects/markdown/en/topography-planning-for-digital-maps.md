Today I couldnâ€™t imagine traveling without Google Maps. While some remote
locations are outdated or missing on map, visualizing the main infrastructure is
crucial for travel safety. I often use Google Maps feature Layers which
generally reflect collections of objects that you add on top of the map to
designate a common association.

## Hiking & bike trips

You can get directions for driving, public transit, walking, ride sharing,
cycling, flight, or motorcycle on Google Maps. Reaching inaccessible sites by
walking can be dangerous, especially on the roads with no sidewalks.

Google Maps offers features like Layers to mark the trails, dedicated lanes,
bicycle friendly roads or unpaved trails on the map view. In some remote areas
it isn't accurate. In northern Germany, for example, the driveway stretches one
third of the road separated apart from the sidewalk, which merges into the bike
lane as the road continues. The road signs are the most reliable, but if you
miss one Google Maps it will take unexpected turns for you in your journey.

Custom styling for the Google Layers will make your next road trip planning
easier.

## How to create custom Layers for Google Maps?

1. Visit [https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/)

2. Use the legacy JSON styling wizard

3. Create Map Style

4. Settings - Import JSON

5. Copy/Paste JavaScript array from any template, e.g.

## Color themes

In a recent survey of 115 mobile users asking what mode they generally have
their mobile device in, roughly 1/3 said dark mode, 1/3 said light mode, and 1/3
said a combination of both. The argument that dark mode improves the user
experience (and accessibility in some cases) always seems to circle back to the
same few reasons, mentioned by users, designers, and developers alike:

- Reduced eye strain

- Battery savings

- Aesthetic appeal

- Improved accessibility for those with visual impairments (e.g., cataracts)

Chromotherapy uses the power of colors to support our mental, emotional, and
physical wellbeing, and it can be extremely important while driving with a car
or measuring long distance.

In this article I listed a few templates that I recommend for Google Maps Web
[https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/), or when
embedding the maps on any website.

## Topography Templates

### The Propia Effect

Red, purple and orange color palette suitable for the dark theme.

### Colorblind-friendly

A stylized map based on the hues of a colorblind-friendly palette. People with
various types of color deficiency, for instance, Tritanopia (blue color vision
deficiency), Deuteranopia (green), Protanopia (red). Orange/red channel is best
perceived regardless of the type of color blindness that a person has. It is at
the end of the color spectrum and transmits maximum contrast, which is not lost
when color perception is altered.

### Areas of Interest Highlight

This style is intended to highlight the copper-colored "areas of interest". It
is useful to cluster the area into the groups of activities.

Tip: filtering areas by keywords in Google reviews categorizes interests and
answers questions related to route planning.
