Excess is no longer in fashion. Creativity is the new luxury. A major goal of More Or Less is to provoke thought about the decisions we make when we buy clothes – factoring in the realities of cost and consumption.  
More Or Less is not another magazine showcasing only current-season fashion but is the first magazine to prioritise sustainabilty in the fashion industry.

Featuring world class photographers, stylists and designers who have accepted challenge to create fashion stories which are more eco-conscious, innovative, fun and with a more accessible price-point. I will highlight few of them:

Teamed up with Microsoft to launch Augmented Atelier, More or Less launch a new digital approach to garment creation that taps four of London’s most cutting-edge fashion designers.  
To create the digital garments, the designers and their teams applied digital processes that transformed their existing design practices and brought their new garments to life in physical space using Microsoft Azure Spatial Anchors which brings the digital garments into the real world and allow multiple people to interact with them in real time, making it the ultimate collaborative tool for design collaboration, retail, and showcasing. It’s a 360 view that shows the real volume, fabric texture, and even motion of the physical garment, providing a much deeper experience than a 2D or 3D rendering, with a much faster, and less wasteful development and iteration process than creating traditional fabric samples.

More Or Less and ARIES ARISE –  
a bespoke capsule collection created from upcycled archive pieces and studio offcuts.  
Making garments in small batches, from raw materials that are the best that can be sourced, in a factory where people feel a responsibility and a connection to the item that they are making, means that not only is the outcome the best possible product, but it’s less wasteful, less harmful.  
‘We have a duty to support manufacturing, even if it comes with less fast gains, we have a duty to know that people aren’t being exploited and how things are being made and dyed. There’s a certain pride in Italy in manufacturing processes. Working with the right factory makes you push boundaries.’

Tim Ryan’s exquisite knitwear combines beauty with comfort, while the designer himself has returned to his roots, making one-off creations by hand. ‘I don’t get the whole ‘sweatpants during lockdown’ thing,” Tim Ryan tells me from his home in Tipperary. “It didn’t make a lot of sense to me. Find something exciting wherever you can, even if it’s only getting up during the day to put on something sparkly to do the washing up.”

Inspired by images of makeshift face masks in the early days of the pandemic, emerging designer San Kim responded with a collection of surreal full-body armour, crafted from reclaimed plastics bags and inflated to comical proportions.
