WeAreDevs is one of the world's largest tech events for developers, software architects, IT specialists and anyone interested in decision-making around the use of technology.

As a moderator I had an opportunity this year to welcome the speakers and work with the community. I was responsible for ensuring sessions start, end and switch on time, maintaining the overall schedule of the event and gathering and incorporating audience feedback.

The overall engagement not only makes the event more responsive to attendees, but it also adds depth to the problems with the two way communication. Maintaining a respectful and productive atmosphere creates a safe space and connection between the speakers and the audience, fostering a sense of community and reflecting upon the audience's needs.

The organisational staff and the volunteer effort makes the congress experience exceptional. On the stages closer to the others all attendees were equipped with the headphones for the seamless listening experience and participation.

The congress isn’t only for the developers. I met several experts with high interest and investments in no-code development platforms, as it makes the product development more standardised and efficient, especially for small products or lack of the high-end technical resources.

AI brings innovations in modern web development replacing the old ways of web application craftsmanship with full automation in web development workflows

One of the speakers, Karan Shetti from Locofy.ai demonstrated the workflow of creating a fully operational YouTube clone using React and design tools with no traditional coding required.

Sami Ekblad, Developer Experience Lead, from the developer perspective explored how voice-driven development can excel with Web Speech API, but also how speech recognition and AI-powered companions can streamline the code-deploy-test cycle, enhancing developer experience, productivity, and real-time feedback.

Finally, quantum computing has become accessible for all backgrounds. Thanks to the multidisciplinary fields comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics utilises quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than on classical computers does. For instance, Shor's algorithm allows a large-scale quantum computer to quickly break essentially all of the encryption systems that are currently used to secure internet traffic against interception.

There are unique discoveries from material science, especially in simulation of materials with quantum effects. For instance, in a single molecule like caffeine or aspirin with 20 to 25 atoms, quantum information can be stored around 10^40 to 10^50 which is close to a number of atoms Earth consists of. It has implications on finding new and more effective materials with specific properties such as drugs in medicine, or optimising battery materials that would be lasting longer, more powerful and contribute in solving renewable energy problems.

Technology and democracy today are linked in terms of distribution of information in politics and divergence of what and how people see in global media from the transformation of young people and generations based on their consumption patterns. The presidency and press coverage across different platforms are closely linked and controlled.
Before the coronavirus disease pandemic the traditional mechanisms in healthcare were not able to solve the problems to avoid or mitigate the effects of pandemic. It was not clear how to revolutionise the technology to accept it within the legal framework and without competition. Governments had their own objectives and value sets to track disease or track the people, which has two different architectural models, but also their valuation of privacy, which is something more important than just a functionality.

The discussion panel about “Impact of Technology on Democracy” with Fanny Jimenez, David Simas, Constantin van Oranje and Vera Futorjanski.

Event moderation makes efficient use of time for the speakers, but it also rules the policies for inclusiveness and a fair chance for different viewpoints to be presented and considered respectfully.
At WeAreDevs world’s congress you have an opportunity to speak and contribute excelling in your career!
