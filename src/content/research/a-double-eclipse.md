For the minorities coming to their country seeking asylum who then find themselves having to contend with the prejudices and half-formed opinions of people who seem to believe in the idea of a place as an informal caste system rather than a full-fledged democracy.  
Such an example of hate speech I will highlight from Jason Montojo’s article for Dr. Dobb’s Journal, monthly magazine published in the United States by UBM Technology Group, covered topics aimed at computer programmers launched at 1976 and becoming the first regular periodical focused on microcomputer software, rather than hardware.  
“Over the last four years, IBM has built a first-class open source IDE in Java called “Eclipse”, and a large development community has grown up around to fix bugs, add features, and build new plug-ins. More importantly, tens of thousands of developers are now using them to build real applications.  
The best thing about Eclipse is its rich feature set; unfortunately, this is also the worst thing about it. With every major and minor release, boatloads of new tools and functionality creep in like illegal immigrants – rarely documenred, often well hidden, and of course, loaded with potential. Fortunately for users, many of these shady productivity boosters have now been rounded up and exposed in Eclipse in Action, by David Gallardo, Ed Burnette, and Robert McGovern; and The Java Developer’s guide to Eclipse, by Sherry Shavor, Jim D’Anjou, Scott Fairbrother, Dan Kehn, John Kellerman, and Pat McCarthy.”  
‘A Double Eclipse’ , Jason Montojo, article for Dr. Dobb’s Journal (ISSN 1044-789X) published by CMP Media LLC, February 2004, 2nd Issue 2, 29th Volume.  
Given the absence of a universally-adopted definition of hate speech or prevention of the publications, lack of monitoring and recognition of racist discourse and hate speech against migrants and refugees, the study has shown ignorance by national authorities and anti-discrimination bodies across Europe by current definitions provided by the Council of Europe, incl. the Council’s Additional Protocol to the Convention of Cybercrime concerning the  
criminalization of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems.  
Due to its special character, including the difficulty of identifying the authors of illegal online content and removing such content, hate speech on the internet creates new demands on law enforcement and judicial authorities in terms of expertise, resources and the need for cross-border cooperation for the prosecution of this crime.
