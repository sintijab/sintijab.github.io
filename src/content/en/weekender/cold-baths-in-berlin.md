Cold water immersion has garnered a lot of
[attention lately](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/style/cold-water-swimming-benefits.html),
especially for its mental health benefits. Researchers in Europe
[have explored](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1550830720300859)
the psychological effects of cold-water swimming and seen
[encouraging results](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15253480/). A 2020 study
conducted in Britain found that 61 people who took a 10-week course to learn to
swim in cold seawater
[experienced greater improvements](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lim2.12)
in mood and well-being than 22 of their friends and family members who watched
them from shore.

Mr. Hof has suggested as much in his book “The Wim Hof Method,” writing that “to
get the most out of the method, you have to mentally invest in it.”

### Leave Your Comfort Zone

We decided to join the Ice Dippers in Berlin, a wonderful, growing community of
creative and experienced pioneers. We distinguish ourselves from others because
we keep challenging our boundaries. When others ask us about our weekend on
Monday, we proudly tell them that we went ice bathing. And we laugh about
ourselves for being so crazy. It feels good not having to do that on your own
but to share that outsideness with others. When you're traveling to Berlin, you
can't miss that!

### Viking Traditions

The ancient Vikings, renowned for their seafaring prowess and warrior spirit,
considered cold water immersion an essential part of their daily lives. Their
longships would often venture into frigid waters, exposing the warriors to
extreme temperatures.

Physical endurance and health benefits were gained from this practice, among the
other immense benefits it provides. Cold water immersion helped strengthen their
cardiovascular health, improve blood flow, and enhance resilience to
environmental stress.

### Challenge as a driver of personal growth

Ice diving is an extreme sport. I couldn't imagine myself going into such a
depths of challenging my own limits if it wasn't for my long-lasting investment
in health, and enjoying every moment by being surrounded by most spectacular
people and the nature.

I learned how do diving with neoprene suit under the water in 10° during the
winter in North Atlantic Ocean. Now swimming from summer through the winter cold
in lakes in Berlin, I know how to get over that first minute in very cold water.
I do wear neoprene gloves and socks, because hands and feet are equipped with
vessels known as arterio-venous anastomoses (AVAs) that are responsible for a
large part of the loss of heat from the body toward the upper end of the
thermoneutral zone.

I like to embrace the full intensity of the cold water. In winter I’m not going
to aim for a distance in swimming, but being mentally and physically prepared
for the upcoming ice diving in Weissensee with professionals and world record
holders in freediving. Just being there is going to be a great challenge for me
and a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
