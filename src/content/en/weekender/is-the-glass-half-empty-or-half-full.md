# **Is the glass half empty or half full?**

The Swiss Science Center Technorama is one of the largest science centers in Europe. With over 500 experiment stations it offers practical examples in science and technology that is fascinating to learn and interact with at any age.

As in the other examples of Wayne Strattman’s work in this exhibition, his recipe is: take a carefully selected mixture of noble gases, enclose these at low pressure in an airtight glass container, and use specifically designed high-frequency electronics to produce a plasma. The combination of these factors produces an ionized gas, which conducts electricity.

Increase the force of gravity 2.8times that is on the surface of the Earth by regulating the electromagnets below iron cylinder wasn’t originated from a monks swinging a heavy cathedral incense burners with enormous amplitudes.

Neither the waves that runs the whole length of the spring in both directions with a minimal effort. Pulling the spring sideways arising the transverse waves and releasing it with a regular impulse will suddenly seem to stand still, but it’s nothing but a interference from a standing waves with the right number of oscillations per second, and their typical form of loops consisting of nodes and antinodes. Whereas longitudinal waves make sound visible.

Waves in springs

An amplifier supplies an alternating current (AC) through the copper coils. The alternating current corresponds in its frequency and amplitude to the vibrations of sound. The permanent magnet and coil together form a “moving coil” which converts the alternating electric current into sound waves. Magnetic fields react to and act upon changing electric currents. The alternating electric current in the coil flows perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. As the direction of the current alternates, the resulting forces push the magnet and coil back and forth. These vibrations move the speaker, plastic panel or the guitar to act as a loudspeaker. Place a coild of the copper wire on a magnet and listen.

An electronic current always creates a magnetic field. In an exhibit with a shape of a field around the long straight wire every part of it contributes the magnetic field at any point of the space, even from parts far away since it is effected by nearby materials that contain iron.  
Along with a field line, a compass needle points in the direction of the magnetic field. By moving the compass in direction it points it will follow a curve of the field line, lines of force, back to the starting point. All magnetic field lines form closed loops.  
When no current flows in the wire, the compass points to North, but when its strongest (about 140 amperes) the magnetic field of the wire is 80 times stringer than the Earth’s field. By convention the North pointing end of compass needle indicates the direction of the magnetic field, whereas by using direct electric current the direction of the field is changing.

Circular magnetic fields

Unless a force acts on a body, it will carry on moving at the same speed in the same direction, that is Newton’s 1st law. Momentum depends on the mass and speed. When two equal masses of metals collide elastically, the metal transfers its momentum and passes it further. With no further influence the total momentum, sum of individual momentum remains as conservation unchanged.

##### **Magnetic or electric – it’s all relative**

Whether we move the magnet towards the wire coil, or the coil towards the magnet, we get the same deflection on the voltmeter, provided that the speed is the same. The direction of the voltmeter deflection depend only on whether the magnet and coil approach one another or move apart, but it doesn’t matter which one moves in accordance to what expect from relativity.  
In 1831 Michael Faraday discovered how to produce an electric current by changing the magnetic field (induction). In 1870 James Clerk Maxwell combined all of the known laws of magnetism and electricity into four equations.  
Unlike sound waves, the speed with which an electromagnetic wave travels is independent of the speed of the source. This result was a significant support for Einstein’s assumption that the speed of light is a universal constant.  
In Relativity theory a single electromagnetic field a consequence of these equations was that changes in magnetic and electric fields are linked together, and that the changes travelled at the speed of light.
