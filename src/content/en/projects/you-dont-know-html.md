Archive [palestineonline.net](//palestineonline.net) was created during the Second Intifada and shows Palestinian cultural aspects in an early history of World Wide Web, sourced from the Internet Archive’s [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). Tracing Palestinian online presence is a form of resistance, connection, and expression in ongoing occupation. It is therefore important to acknowledge what cannot be taken away, that is Palestinian identity and loyalty to their nation independent from oppressors and ongoing war.

I discovered this study content from 2002 with HTML 4 and CSS by Yahya Al-Sharif from the city of Nablus in Palestine, a member of an early [HTML Writers Guild](https://hwg.org/resources/faqs/memberFAQ.html), who teaches web design using the HTML and the design graphics program.

The introduction starts with the intent of the course to create an easy-to-understand course about HTML and web design in Arabic and expresses the lack of Arabic resources compared to other languages, as it is limited or almost non-existent.

Although the content is corresponding to the time it was created in 1999, it represents the HTML standard from which newer versions to the latest HTML5 have been adapted to.

I created a list of questions that derive from HTML4 to HTML5 versioning, and the references to the Yahya’s HTML4 course content lessons from 1999.

Now looking back 25 years later I find similar teaching methodologies. Referencing information with practical code examples and the level of explainability in documentation is so valuable.

Although I was able to read the course by translating the website, I understand the effort and long investment to create and improve the course content for educating the Arabic speaking community from Palestinians at the time when language and cultural barriers were present in a global medium of World Wide Web.
